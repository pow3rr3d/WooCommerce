Display WooCommerce products prices by user roles.

== Description ==

**[Price based on User Role for WooCommerce](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/price-user-role-woocommerce/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=PriceByUserRole)** plugin lets you display WooCommerce products prices by user roles.

Prices can be set **globally** or on **per product** basis.

When setting prices **globally**, you just need to set price multiplier for each user role.

When setting prices **per product** basis, you can set exact price for each product. Works with variable products.

You can also **hide product prices** for selected user roles.
